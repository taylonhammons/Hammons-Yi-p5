1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code.

2. **DONE:** Finish reading the project description.

3. **PROB:** Public key access denied. We could pull properly but couldn't push any of our new project decription When we did finally push, we weren't sure if wr upstreamed c\
orrectly


## TUES 2017-11-28

1. **DONE** done ulpoding skeleton code

2. **DONE* Reading project description in full.

3. **DONE** Team meeting where we decided the two games implementing is Breakout and American checkers

4. **DONE** Scheduled all further team meetings and agreed which partner is doing what specifics for the game.

5. **TODO** Design basic graphics for Checkers and Breakout. We decided to start with basic animation first wihtout including movement and player differences\
. We will code most verything as basically and generalized as possible then create more technnical graphics later.

6. **PROB** Design implementation. We need to figure out the best way to implment multiple players while still keeping graphics stabalized. We don't want muc\
h to change on a level by level basis or when there are different players. Our plan is so generalize as much code as possible to optimize how it can be used \
within our code.
